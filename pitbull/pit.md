By trying out all types of commands for gathering metadata I saw that only Blocks are different on each file, so possibly each block contains some encoding of a letter. They are too large to be decoded to ASCII so probably they have to be divided by some common factor. By looking at the numbers it seems that the common factor is 8, so we can use a script that parses the files metadata and combines the ASCII value of each file from the Block.
