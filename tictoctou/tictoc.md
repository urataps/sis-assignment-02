Logged in to the vm using ssh, and inspected the tictoctou folder. The flag is only readable to root obviously, so I need to do some privilege escalation. The tictoc binary is the way to do that since it's owned by root and has execute privileges. After downloading and analyzing it locally with `strings` and `strace` it appears the binary gets a random number, writes it to a tmp file, sleeps for some small time, reads the file and shows the flag if you guessed the number. By analyzing the binary with `strings` I see that `You're so lucky! Here's you flag: %s` message is displayed when you guess the flag. To get the flag we can try to exploit during the time that the tictoc binary sleeps, we can try to write the number we gave as guess (the simplest being 0) and then the program will give us the flag.
