The binary seems to require  an input with same length as the flag, and by checking it with ls -l we cam see that the flag has 37 bytes, which means the string is composed of 36 characters. By giving a correct string length the program gives back a length that should describe how close you are to the flag (I guessed that by inputting `SIS_CTF` and seeing lower values), so when it's 0 we guessed the flag. Now we should just make a script that goes through all characters for each position and take the one that gives us the lowest value.
